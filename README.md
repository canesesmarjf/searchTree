# searchTree
This code works as a binary, quad or oct search tree. It takes in the pointer of the raw data. The search method will return the pointer to the node containing the found data in the form of indices. These indices are applied to the raw data to extract the found data.

NOTE:
I have not included the INSTALL.sh for armadillo library needed to run this code. Such shell script will unpack the armadillo tar file and carry out the installation into a directory in the PWD called "libs_arma".
The MAKEFILE needs to be modified to reflect the location of the libs_arma directory.
